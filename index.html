			<h1>Why OSGi enRoute?</h1>
			<p>
				OSGi is <em>arguably</em> the best way to develop software systems
				and take advantage of modularity. However, until now the threshold
				to get started was high due to lack of a good tool chain, proper
				service based libraries, and tutorials, with the consequence that
				many people gave up before the benefits became visible.
			<p>The vision of the OSGi Alliance with the enRoute project is
				therefore to make OSGi as easy as possible for developers to get
				started with OSGi without compromising its core values.

			<h1>What is OSGi enRoute?</h1>
			<p>First, OSGi enRoute is a project under construction that will
				remain under construction for some time. That said, a lot of work
				has ALREADY been done and the overal structure is clear. What we are
				planning to have in the near future is:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Community</b> – A growing community (well, any new
					project will easily have a growing community, please join!).
				<li><b>Programming Model</b> – A quite cool, best practice
					µservice based development model.
				<li><b>Tool Chain</b> – A selected tool chain that supports the
					OSGi programming model over all the stages of development.
				<li><b>Profiles</b> – A mechanism for creating sets of service
					contracts and capabilities so that developers can decouple
					themselves from implementation details. Currently there is one
					profile, the base profile.
				<li><b>Education</b> – A (hopefully growing) number of
					tutorials.
			</ul>

			<h1>How to get started?</h1>

			<p>
				If you are a developer and want to try out the tool chain then start
				with the <a href="/tutorials/base/index.html">base tutorial</a>.
				This is a zero-knowledge required tutorial that guides you through
				all the principles of developing with enRoute. This tutorial will
				work you through all the basics.
			<p>
				If you are an architect and want to know more about what enRoute is
				and does then you start reading the <a href="book/210-overview.html">overview</a>
				of the enRoute project
			<p>
				If you're interested in the enRoute Profiles, you can find more to
				read in the <a href="book/400-datasheets.html"></a>
